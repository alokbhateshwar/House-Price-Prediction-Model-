## 🏡 House Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

### 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other property-related factors. The model uses a **Random Forest Regressor** from **scikit-learn** for accurate regression analysis.

---

### ✅ Features Used (Example):

*(Update these with your actual feature names)*

* Area (Square Feet)
* Number of Bedrooms
* Number of Bathrooms
* Garage Space
* Location Index
* ... (Add all relevant features from your dataset)

---

### ✅ Dataset Information:

* **Target Column:** `House_Price`
* **Type:** Supervised Regression
* **Size:** *(Mention number of rows and columns if you want)*
* **Data Split:** 75% Train / 25% Test

---

### ✅ Workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning**
2. **Feature Selection**
3. **Train-Test Split**
4. **Model Training:** RandomForestRegressor
5. **Prediction**
6. **Model Evaluation:**

   * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   * R-squared (R²) Score
7. **Visualization:**

   * Actual vs Predicted House Prices (Bar Chart)

---

### ✅ Model Performance:

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** `7.58`
* **R-squared Score (R²):** `0.89`
  *(Indicates 89% variance explained by the model)*

---

### ✅ Tools and Libraries Used:

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

---

### ✅ How to Run:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook / VS Code.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Run the data preprocessing and model training cells.
4. Check predictions and evaluation metrics.
5. Visualize Actual vs Predicted results.

---

### ✅ Upcoming Improvements:

* Hyperparameter tuning
* Use XGBoost or Gradient Boosting
* Cross-validation
* Deploy as a Web App (Streamlit / Flask)
